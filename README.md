# BICpack

R-functions for Bayesian model selection and hypothesis testing using default Bayes factors. Currently, the package only contains a functions for computing the BIC for order constrianed models (Mulder & Raftery, 2019). The functions needs a fitted model (e.g., glm, survival) as input as well as a string that specifies a set of order constraints on the regression coefficients.

Basic example
-------------

``` r
library(BICpack)


salary <- read.table("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/salary.dat", header=TRUE)

# Testing a model assuming a positive gender effect versus a model assuming a negative
# gender effect versus a model assuming no gender effect.

# fit a model with all effects present
salfit <- glm( sl ~ sx + rk + yr + dg + yd, family = gaussian, data=salary)
# a model which assumes a positive effect for being male
bic_oc(salfit,"sxmale>0")
# a model which assumes a negative effect for being male
bic_oc(salfit,"sxmale<0")

# fit a model excluding the gender effect
salfit0 <- glm( sl ~ rk + yr + dg + yd, family = gaussian, data=salary)
# a model which assumes no gender effect
bic_oc(salfit0)

# getting posterior probabilities of the models assuming they are equally likely a priori
bicvec <- c(bic_oc(salfit, "sxmale > 0"), bic_oc(salfit,"sxmale < 0"), bic_oc(salfit0))
postprob(bicvec)

# testing for an ordered effect that salary increases from assistent to associate, and from
# associate to full professor
bic_oc(salfit,"rkfull > rkassociate > 0")
bic_oc(salfit,"rkfull > rkassociate > 0", complement = TRUE)

# the BIC for the order hypothesis can also be obtained by separately specifying the constraints
# using the ampersant '&'
bic_oc(salfit,"rkfull > rkassociate & rkassociate > 0")
```
